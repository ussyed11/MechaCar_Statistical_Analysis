## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
In the MechaCar dataset, ground_clearance and vehicle_length provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. In addition, there is evidence that vehicle_weight may have also provided a slight amount of variance to the mpg values, but this is not significant (if we use a significance level of 0.05). According to the multiple linear regression model, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of the hypothesis test was 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level. The multiple regression model does an adequate job of predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the multiple r-squared value was 0.71. Which means that roughly 71% of the time the model will predict mpg values correctly. Most likely there are other more impactful variables and factors that were not captured in the dataset that contribute to the mpg variability of the MechaCar prototypes.
